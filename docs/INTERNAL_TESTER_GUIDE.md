## 📥 How to Install

You don't need to download anything from the store. Just follow these simple steps to load the "Internal Build" into your Chrome browser.

1.  **Get the Build**:
    *   If you received a `.zip` file, **unzip it** first. You should see a folder (likely named `dist` or containing `manifest.json`).

2.  **Open Extension Management**:
    *   Open Google Chrome.
    *   In the address bar, type `chrome://extensions` and press **Enter**.

3.  **Enable Developer Mode**:
    *   Look at the top-right corner of the page.
    *   Toggle the switch for **Developer mode** to **ON** (blue).

4.  **Load the Extension**:
    *   Click the **Load unpacked** button that appeared in the top-left area.
    *   Select the folder you unzipped (or the `dist` folder if you have the source code).
    *   **Tab Triage** should now appear in your list of extensions! 🎉

## ⚡️ How to Use

Tab Triage is designed to be fast and keyboard-friendly.

### 1. Start a Review
*   Click the **Tab Triage icon** in your toolbar, or use the shortcut:
    *   **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + E`
    *   **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + E`
*   The extension will open in a focused window, showing you one tab at a time.

### 2. Triage Your Tabs
Decide what to do with the current tab shown. You can use buttons or keyboard shortcuts:

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keep** | `O` | Keeps the tab open and moves to the next one. |
| **Close** | `X` / `Delete` | Closes the tab immediately. Satisfying! |
| **Save for Later** | `S` | Saves the tab to a special "Saved" list within the extension (bookmarks for your mind). |
| **Add Note** | `N` | Add a quick thought or reminder to the tab. |
| **Skip** | `Right Arrow` | Skip this tab for now and come back later. |

### 3. Background Magic
*   **Sync**: If you close a tab in your main browser window, it automatically disappears from your review queue.
*   **Persistence**: The review window stays open locally so you don't lose your place.
